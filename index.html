		  <p>This first course of Exploring the Bible: The Dickinson Series gives students a broad overview of the entire Bible, including chapters on how to select a Bible suitable for your needs, how the Bible is organized, how the collection of books that comprise the Bible were chosen, different ways that people approach the text, and what archaeology has to tell us about the text and its stories.

This six-week course in basic biblical literacy assumes no prior knowledge of the Bible and is not biased toward any particular Christian tradition.  In fact, it is being successfully used in both Protestant and Catholic churches, in ecumenical groups, in interfaith groups, and in groups that mix church folks, agnostics, and atheists.  You can get started right away.
